Semantic Analysis To Do's:
    - Add a "used" field to each local variable in order to check for unusedLocalVariable error
    - When you declare a class, you need to also declare a function with the same name
        (the constructor) so that you can legally instantiate an instance of the class.
        How do you get the parameter signature from the constructor inside the class?
